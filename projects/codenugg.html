        <p>codenuggets.com is my blog that I started around 2010. Initially the blog is my personally notebook, but as the contents of the blog grew, the information became useful for other people. The site contains articles of database management, server management, web design, and software engineering.</p>

        <p>I designed a new theme for this site at the beginning of 2014. The new theme gave a simpler and cleaner interface. The code for the new theme can be found in the GitHub repository.</p>
