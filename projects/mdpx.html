        <p>Magnetized Dusty Plasma Experiment (<a href="http://psl.physics.auburn.edu/research/mdpx-pages/mdpx-physics-mission.html" target="_blank">MDPX</a>) is a project initiated at Physics Department of Auburn University that hosts one of the largest study of magnetized plasma in the world. This project is a database management system I designed and implemented for the MDPX project.</p>

        <p>This project is divided into two parts: the database and the data management software. The database itself contains data model that holds experiment setup, set-points, and results. The data management software is a web-based user interface that allows the user to view, add or modify the records in the database. The user interface also implements user and access control to allow multiple users to operate on the system.</p>
