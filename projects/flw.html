        This game was a project for a data structure and algorithms course. In traditional game of hangman, the computer picks a random word for the player to guess. This game does things a little differently: it tries to find words that do not match the player's guess, but without appearing so. This game never actually have a secret word, but adapts from user input.

        This game plays dirty by first partitioning the dictionary according to the user input. The program then picks a partition using a partially randomized algorithm. Ideally, the algorithm that picks a partition should pick a partition that makes the player miss to make the game harder, but doing so will make the game appear deterministic and suspicious. The trick is to make the game appear random, but still not let the player win!
