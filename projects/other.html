        <p>The following are a list of other projects I have coded:
        <ol>
            <li>Auburn InterConnect: An event management system for Auburn Graduate School written in ASP.NET. Unfortunately, due to constant growth of scope of the project, it was never launched. The code of this project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/wangchj/Auburn-Interconnect" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</li>
            <li>Hilbert Transform: given input parameters, this little program maps a set of 2D spatial coordinates into an integer based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve" target="_blank">Hilbert space-filling curve</a>. The code of this project is hosted on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/hilbert-transform/" target="_blank">Google Code</a>.</li>
            <li>Various organizations websites</li>
