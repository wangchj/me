        <p>INTACT is a research project to build an encrypted spatial database that still allows searching of point of interests (POIs) using special constraints. An encrypted spatial database protects proprietary data from third parties in a cloud environment, in which the database is hosted by a service provider. Our encryption aims to allow approximating POI location without first decrypting the spatial data and there fore exposing valuable data.
